tweedie is a Python library implementing scipy's ``rv_continuous`` class
for the Tweedie family. The Tweedie family is a member of the exponential
dispersion model family and is commonly used in the insurance indsutry
to model claim amounts for insurance policies (exposure).

The main focus of this package is the compound-Poisson behavior,
specifically where :math:`1 < p < 2`. However, it should be possible to
calculate the distribution for all the possible values of p.
